        </b>
        <p>Athens is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's
            oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning around 3,400 years. Classical Athens was a powerful
            city-state. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it
            is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy,largely due to the
            impact of its cultural and political achievements during the 5th and 4th centuries BC in later centuries on the
            rest of the then known European continent.Today a cosmopolitan metropolis, modern Athens is central to economic,
            financial, industrial, political and cultural life in Greece.
